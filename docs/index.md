## Exploring the collaboration landscape of leading machine- and deep-learning Github repositories

Our project aims to analyze the collaborative networks within the most prominent GitHub repositories related to deep learning and machine learning. By examining the connections between collaborators, we seek to uncover patterns of collaboration and understand the flow of ideas within these communities. Furthermore, we want to identify key topics/subjects that the repositories cover and find similarities between the topics across the repositories.

On this website you can gain insight in the collaborative GitHub landscape of the highest rated Machine-Learning and Deep-Learling repositories.
